> Dear potential partner,  
I am reaching out to you in the hopes of finding assistance for my work as a software developer. As a resident of China, I am unable to access freelancer platforms like [upwork.com](https://www.upwork.com) due to country restrictions. I want to be transparent about this limitation.  
I am seeking someone who would be willing to allow me to use their [upwork.com](https://www.upwork.com) account to pursue freelance opportunities. To ensure the security of your account, I would need to remotely access it through your PC. Rest assured, I will only use your PC for accessing your account, and I guarantee that there will be no harm or damage caused.  
I am looking for an individual with an open mind who is willing to help me continue my work. In return for your assistance, I am more than willing to share the income generated through the account.  
If you are able to provide this support, I would be immensely grateful for your help. However, if this request is not suitable for you, I completely understand and appreciate your consideration.  
Please feel free to contact me.  
I would be delighted to discuss further details with you.  
  
> And if you have a basic background in software development and possess good English communication skills, we can work together to improve our job performance.  
Your role would involve having brief calls with the clients I bring in and reaching an agreement with them.  
I provide yo with the necessary information that you should know before each call so that you can handle anything in the call easily.  
Once the call is done, you would update me with the details of the conversation, and I will handle the rest of the tasks.  
Your main responsibility would be to utilize your communication skills effectively.
